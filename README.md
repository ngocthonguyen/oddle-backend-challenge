## General info
A simple weather checking API service.
	
## Technologies
* Java 1.8
* Spring Boot 2.4.3
* MySQL 5

## Setup
**Prerequisites:**

You need to update the database config to point to your desired database first.

**Run:**
```
$ ./gradlew bootRun
```

## User stories

|Requirements|User Story|Priority|
|---|---|---|
|Search for today weather of a specific city|As an API consumer, I should be able to search for today's weather by inputting the city name.|High|
||||
|Save weather data|As an API consumer, I should be able to save weather data for retrieval|High|
||||
|Get historical weather data|As an API consumer,  I should be able to look for weather data from past periods|High
||||
|Delete historical weather data|As an API consumer,  I should be able to delete an existing weather record|Medium
||||
|Update historical weather data|As an API consumer, I should be able to update an existing weather record|Medium
||||
|Able to ensure existing function is working|As an API contributor, I should be able to make sure my contribution won’t break existing function|Low

## Weather API Provider

https://openweathermap.org/current
> Access current weather data for any location on Earth including over 200,000 cities! We collect and process weather data from different sources such as global and local weather models, satellites, radars and vast network of weather stations. Data is available in JSON, XML, or HTML format.

## Requirements
* The server should be written in Java Spring / Spring Boot and Hibernate. The client will consume RESTFUL APIs provided by the server.
* Follow coding best practices.
* Understanding of API Designs (both REST and GraphQL are accepted with no preference)
* Understanding  of Spring Boot framework
* Show considerations for Speed, Efficiency, and Scalability in your APIs and Database design and coding
* Show how existing functions can be tested efficiently when introducing new feature

## Notes
* Ensure that you understand the requirements of the assignment before continuing.
* Add in adequate comments to explain your codes. (If you need to write a documentation to explain your solution, please do so)
* Tell the consumer how to consume your API. Documentation is great, actual way to run your APIs are even greater.
* Design and attach your .sql file when you submit your project.
* If additional setup is required, please update README.md that explains the steps to get the assignment working.
* Think about how big the data can become and what to do about it
* Think about scaling your app. You do not need to implement it now.

## Submission Steps
* **FORK** the repository https://github.com/oddle-developer/oddle-backend-challenge to your machine
* Duplicate it to **PRIVATE** repository on your Github account (https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/duplicating-a-repository)
* Checkout a **NEW BRANCH** for your changes
* Code. Commit and Push as many times as you want, only the **LAST Pull Request** will be graded
* Create a Pull Request from your new branch in your private repo and invite us as reviewer
* Add https://github.com/oddle-hire-java as collaborator for your repo and add `oddle-hire-java` as reviewer to your PR

## Implementation
* Many Spring components have been created to implement required user stories (JPA Entities, Repositories, Services, Mappers, Controllers, REST DTO...)
* Because of the short time limit, only a simple data model is used (Weather with city name, date and some other fields).
* Some TODOs have been added into the code to improve the data model and the application's behavior
* It would be interesting to implement other components like Security, AOP, Data Validation, WebFlux (for performance)...

## To run the application
**Go to the application folder:**
```
$ cd weather
```
**Run MySQL via docker:**
```
$ docker compose up
```
**Run the Spring Boot application:**
```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

## 3 ways to test the application
**Unit tests**
```
$ mvn test
```
**Swagger interface**
```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```
**Postman**

A PostMan project has been added to execute a functional test scenario
```
weather/Weather.postman_collection.json
```
